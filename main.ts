// Question 10:
// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
//If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
//Then, write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Asharib, 2024-03-05
// This program prints a personal message.
let myName: string = "Asharib";
console.log(`Hello ${myName}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`);


// Question 11:

//Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names. 
//Print each personâ€™s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

let names: string[] = ["Muhammad Saad", "Khizar", "Talha"];
console.log(names[0]);
console.log(names[1]);
console.log(names[2]);

//another method of doing it
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i]);
}

//Question 12:
// Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them.
// The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
   console.log(` Hello ${names[i]}, would you like to join our study group?`);
